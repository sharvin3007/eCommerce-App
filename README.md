# eCommerce App

This is a responsive front-end application built in React project.

## App Overview

This project was built in React. The app focuses on allowing users to choose between several t-shirt sizes for female clothing and based on the information, options are displayed. Using the useEffect Hook and Fetch API, data is collected from an external JSON file and incorporated into the application.

## Technology

* React (v.18.2.0)
* Bootstrap (v.5.2.0)

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Linting

ESLint is used to lint the application code. 
```
# Run Linter
npm run lint

# Auto Fix ESLint Issues
npm run lint:fix
```
